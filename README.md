# Calculator_the_Game_Solver

This will hopefully be able to provide solutions to problems from the app Calculator: The Game. Given the number of moves, starting value, target value, and available operations, this program (written in Python) should return a series (preferably the shortest) of moves to get to the target value. This will probably be with a recursive (with memoization) exhaustive search type algorithm that probably just tries all different combinations until it either gets to the target or runs out of moves. The exponential running time of this algorithm will probably be acceptable given the low number of moves typically allowed to reach the target and the limited number of options of operations typically available. Adding in heuristics to make the search more intelligent could be a cool addition though.
